MsaViewer is a graphical interface for multiple sequences alignments.

It gives different statistical informations about a multiple sequence alignment like column conservation score and column amino acid counts.

The features will evolve with the project.

This software is first developed for Macosx plateforme but we will propose a windows version when the first release will be available
